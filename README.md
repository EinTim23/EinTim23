# Hi there, I'm EinTim 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate **Developer** and **Reverse Engineer** from Germany that loves making and breaking DRMs ;). With years of experience in software development and deep technical knowledge, I enjoy tackling complex challenges, whether it's building innovative solutions or dissecting existing ones to understand their inner workings.

## 🛠️ My Skillset

- **Programming Languages**: C/C++, Objective C, Go, Dart, C#, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Flutter, Vue JS, Electron, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Git
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, iOS
- **Reverse Engineering**: x86, arm64 and some power pc assembly, Binary analysis, debugging

## Projects

- My own software DRM that hasn't been cracked yet, reverse engineering samples can be obtained for free by contacting me
- [Monarch](https://monarchupload.cc), a collection of my fun projects which currently includes a forum, file sharing and e-mail provider
- Overdose, my private cheat provider with sophisticated anticheat bypass and a fully automated unique build system
- PS4 linux port for firmware 11.00 ([modded warfare video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlsdUcYrV2M), [My initial showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4DBDMqlgkI))
- [PlayerLink](https://github.com/EinTim23/PlayerLink) Small cross plattform C++ GUI application to link various media players to discord
- [Phantom IM](https://github.com/sphinx-soft/im-server/tree/trunk) Phantom IM was a reimplementation of the backend for old instant messengers like MySpaceIM. Fully made from scratch based on my reversal
- Snapchat jailbreak and sideloading detection bypass, currently used by [one of the biggest Snapchat modifications for ios out there](https://repo.objcmsgsend.dev/)
- Many more things I made over the years but never publicly released on various platforms/video game consoles. 

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

- Diving deeper into low-level programming and operating system internals.
- Exploring advanced reverse engineering techniques and tools.
- Developing CPU emulators and type 1 hypervisors

## 🧠 My Philosophy

- **Problem-Solving First**: I believe in solving problems with the simplest, most effective solutions.
- **Clean Code**: Write code that is easy to read, maintain, and extend.
- **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves, and so should we.
